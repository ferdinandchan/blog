## What is this book about?
The book starts with an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) development until 2024. It helps readers understand how AI is shaking up different aspects of our lives and its benefits and associated risks. The significant advancement of AI's capability and intelligence confronts us with the question of identity - Is human intelligence the key differentiator that makes us different and superior to other creatures? If not, what makes humans "human"? 

The author offers his answer based on the Bible and his Christian faith, and concludes the book with suggestions on how to be wise in using AI and how "having the sure hope from Jesus" helps Christians face the challenges posed by AI.

## My takeaways

* Like all other tools, AI is neutral and is not inherently good or bad. It depends on how we use it. However, the more powerful the tool is, the more careful and thoughtful we should be when we use it.
* Christians benefit from knowing the "end" and should make assessments and decisions through that lens.
* AI is going to stay. I should start thinking about using it for God's kingdom and others' good while always considering its danger and having guardrails in place.

## Who would I recommend this book to?

* People who want to have a brief overview on the changes that AI could bring to us
* People who want to understand how the Bible and Christian faith could help us look at the challenges and opportunities brought by AI

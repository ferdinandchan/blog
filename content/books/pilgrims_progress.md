## What is this book about?
The Pilgrim's Progress is Bunyan's attempt to illustrate the fellowship, sufferings and challenges that followers of Jesus will go through. Not only he managed to faithfully portraits the Christian journay based on the teachings from the Bible but also makes it accessible to people who are not familiar with the Bible. He takes the readers through different stages of Christian's life such as rependance and reborn, evangelism and rejections, sufferings and preservance, missteps and corrections, etc, and prompts the readers to reflect on their walk with Jesus and fellowship with other brothers and sisters.

## My takeaways

* Followers of Jesus should expect their journey in this world to be full of challenges and sufferings. But it will be a rewarding journey that build up their faith and full of joy as they experience God's grace and presence along the way. 
* Christian fellowship is a partnership between followers of Jesus who walk side-by-side with each other, to encourage and support one another, and to rebuke and spur each other during their journey of faith to follow Jesus.

## Who would I recommend this book to?

* People who are curious about the challenges and sufferings that followers of Jesus will face and how they endure the sufferings with joy.
* Followers of Jesus who would like to reflect on their own spiritual journey and their walk with Jesus

# AI Manifesto
AI is a powerful tool that could revolutionalise our society in many different ways and reshape how individuals interact with others. Like all other powerful innovations, the tools themselves are not inheritly good or bad. Whether they will bring a positive or negative impact to the society is depends on the user of the tools. In particular, what kind of problems are we solving with these tools, our understandings of the consequences (both good and bad) that these tools could bring and what guardrails we have in place to reduce or even restraint the unintended bad consequences.

Hence, I created this AI manifesto to help me think through when, what and how I use AI, the principles that guide my decisions and some specific dos and don'ts. The development and advancement of AI will not stop and thus I will regularly update this manifesto as I learned more about AI, my experiences in using them in different areas and the development of the technology itself.

# Principles
- Personal relationship is key
As christian, I believe God creates human to be relational and we are called to love and care for one another. While human interactions are not always perfect and requires effort and humility to keep it going, we should never replace human interaction with bot interactions (which are tailored and designed to make us feel good)

- Hard works and frictions can be good
I believe that we should not blindly chase after efficiency by removing all the hardworks and frictions in the things that we worked on. We learned and grow through hard works and fricitions help us think carefully whether something is worth pursuing or not. They also serve as limiters that help us to better prioritise and invest our energy and effort in things that are truly matter to us

- Quality over quantity
Similar to above, I 

- AI is an amazing prediction machine
The advancement in maths and technology drastically improve AI's ability to process data and find correlations and patterns in those data. It is great at predicting the outcome based on the vast amount of data that it processed and the numerous "trials and experiments" that it performed. However, this makes it a great "prediction machine" but it will never be a "truth telling" machine.





# Guardrails

- Help me think better but not think for me
The willingness to do the hard work to think is something I value and actively improving. AI is great at processing a large amount of data and drawing conclusions based on them. These are definitly useful reference materials that could help me think better and challenge my assumptions. However, it is always tempting to delegate the thinking (which is hard work) to the LLM and be "productive" to just use it's answer. However, this will take away the chance for us to learn and shapen my thinking skills.


- Zero trust on LLM's answer and generated content


- Never personalise or anthrophtise AI


- I decide when to use AI, not the other way around
